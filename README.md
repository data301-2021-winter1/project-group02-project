## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

With this analytics project, we are interested in finding if there is gender equality in relation to the following variables: employment and unemployment rate and the percentile earnings in each of the majors listed in the data set. We as international students agreed to work in this dataset because it is a topic we all can relate with, as we understand the concern of not finding a job after graduation or not earning enough money after all the effort and time we have spent in university. Especifically, we want to consider if men are getting more opportunities to receive a job and, after receiving it, are they having higher salaries than women? Thus, we have smaller interest questions that will help us to answer our overall research question. Furthermore, building a user facing dashboard is viable for our dataset as we have enough sample sets which can help us visualize comparisons that need to be made to answer our research question. So yes, building this type of interface can help us to get more deep conclusions as data is easier to read and understand, even more for the general audience. 

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

This dataset was available on Kaggle and the original source was through the American Community Survey. All the data is from the American Community Survey 2010-2012 Public Use Microdata series and licensed by Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0). The data was collected during this period of time. The college major dataset is a composition of the following columns such as major, gender, employment rates, unemployment rates, types of jobs, percentile earnings, median earnings of full time/part time students etc. Overall, it contains information on the labor force, with more detailed breakdowns.

The purpose of this dataset was to provide public interest regarding views on the economic worth of college degrees. It is a Public Use Microdata Sample, which allows users to create custom edits and tables with the data. The data is collected through surveys by people that includes questionnaires sent in my mail and in person. For our research question, we have decided to focus on gender, employment and unemployment rates, and percentile earnings.
